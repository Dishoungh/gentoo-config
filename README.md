The whole point of this repo is to document everything I do while configuring a custom kernel on Gentoo. I have an Arch build on the side to use as my main while Gentoo is for educational purposes for right now. If I like it enough, I might switch Gentoo as my main. Yes, I have used a distribution kernel on Gentoo before and frankly, I did not find it satisfying enough. I have seen people customize their own kernel and make a custom build. I want to do that too. Because of that, I am not tailoring this "guide" with using a distribution kernel. I'm configuring a custom build purely for my learning experience. I don't care if it technically doesn't make sense. It's something that I want to do, so I'm going to do it lol.
