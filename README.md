The whole point of this repo is to try out Gentoo Linux and see if I like it better than Arch.

Plus, at some point, I'm going to get me a much bigger M.2 SSD at some point that I will put either Gentoo or Arch on as my main distro.
The other will be put on a virtual machine. So, I will do an install guide for both myself and potentially whoever else is reading this. Feel free to use this as a guide for building your system too.
