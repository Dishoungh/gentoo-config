The whole point of this repo is to learn how to build a custom kernel on Gentoo while having an Arch main. Gentoo is for educational purposes for right now, but if I like it enough, I might switch Gentoo as my main.

NO, I am not using distribution kernels. I'm doing it custom. Otherwise, I would go back to maining Arch since I find using Arch with the AUR a superior experience than using Gentoo. The whole point of using trying Gentoo for me is so I can try setting a custom kernel on it.
