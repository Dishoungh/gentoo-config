The whole point of this repo is to help me learn how to build a custom kernel on Gentoo while having an Arch main on the side. Gentoo is for educational purposes for right now, but if I like it enough, I might switch Gentoo as my main.

NO, I am not using distribution kernels. I'm configuring a custom build. Otherwise, I would go back to maining Arch. The whole point of me trying Gentoo with a custom-made kernel for me is purely for my learning experience. I don't care if it technically doesn't make sense. It's something that I want to do, so I'm going to do it lol.
