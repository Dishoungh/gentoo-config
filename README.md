These are NOT install guides. They're more like traces of my install process in order to help others help me fix problems with my installs.

The whole point of this repo is to document everything I do while configuring a custom kernel on Gentoo. I have an Arch build on the side to use as my main while Gentoo is for educational purposes for right now. If I like it enough, I might switch Gentoo as my main.
